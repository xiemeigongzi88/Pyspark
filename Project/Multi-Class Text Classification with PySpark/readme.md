# Multi-Class Text Classification with PySpark
  The idea will be to use PySpark to create a pipeline to analyse this data and create a classifier that will classify questions. In future questions could be auto-tagged by such a classifier or tags could be recommended to users prior to posting.

  Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/data

## Steps: 
  Data Ingestion and Extraction
  
  Model Pipeline
  
  Model Training and Evaluation: Logistic Regression using Count Vector Features; Logistic Regression using TF-IDF Features; Naive Bayes; Random Forest; 

## Conclusion: 
  This analysis was done with relatively simple models. 
  I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data and PySpark. And this project was inspired by the project “Multi-Class Text Classification with PySpark”. https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-text-classification-with-pyspark-7d78d022ed35
