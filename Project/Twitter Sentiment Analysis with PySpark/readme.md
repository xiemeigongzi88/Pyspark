# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with PySpark 
  Sentiment analysis is the automated process that uses AI to identify positive, negative and neutral opinions from text. Sentiment analysis is widely used for getting insights from social media comments, survey responses, and product reviews, and making data-driven decisions.
  Twitter allows businesses to reach a broad audience and connect with customers without intermediaries. On the downside, it can harm a brand’s reputation if negative content about the brand suddenly goes viral – you might end up with an unexpected PR crisis on your hands. This is one of the reasons why social listening ― monitoring conversation and feedback in social media ― has become a crucial process in social media marketing.
